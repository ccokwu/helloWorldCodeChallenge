> Generate a changelog from git metadata


## Why

- Used by AngularJS and related projects.
- Everything internally or externally is pluggable.
- High performant. It doesn't spawn any extra child process to fetch data.
- Intelligently setup defaults but you can still modify them to your needs.
- Fully configurable. There are several presets that you can use if you just want to use the same conventions. But it is also possible to configure if you want to go down to the nth degree.
- Task runner integrations: [grunt](https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog)/[gulp](https://github.com/stevemao/gulp-conventional-changelog).
- Actively maintained.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install conventional-changelog
```

*Note:* As 0.1.x this module is rewritten and so the API is not backward compatible. If you are still using 0.0.x please checkout the README in your downloaded package or dig through the old tags.

## Usage

```js
var conventionalChangelog = require('conventional-changelog');

conventionalChangelog({
  preset: 'angular'
})
  .pipe(process.stdout);
```


## API

### conventionalChangelog([options, [context, [gitRawCommitsOpts, [parserOpts, [writerOpts]]]]])

Returns a readable stream.

#### options

##### preset

Type: `string` Possible values: `'angular'`, `'jquery'`, `'jshint'`, `'eslint'`

A set of options of a popular project so you don't have to define everything in options, context, gitRawCommitsOpts, parserOpts or writerOpts manually. The preset values can be overwritten.

##### pkg

Type: `object`

###### path

Type: `string` Default: `'package.json'`

The location of your "package.json".

###### transform

Type: `function` Default: pass through

A function that takes `package.json` data as the argument and returns the modified data. Note this is performed on the normalized package.json data. Useful when you need to add a leading 'v' to your version, etc.

##### append

Type: `boolean` Default: `false`

Should the log be appended.

##### allBlocks

Type: `boolean` Default: `false`

Set to `true` if you want to generate all blocks of the log. `false` if you just want to generate the current one.

##### warn

Type: `function` Default: `function() {}`

A warn function. EG: `grunt.verbose.writeln`

##### transform

Type: `object` Default: `through.obj()`

A transform stream that applies after the parser and before the writer.

#### context

See the [conventional-changelog-writer](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-writer) docs. There are some defaults:

##### host

Default: normalized host found in `package.json`.

##### version

Default: version found in `package.json`.

##### owner

Default: extracted from normalized `package.json` `repository.url` field.

##### repository

Default: extracted from normalized `package.json` `repository.url` field.

#### gitRawCommitsOpts

See the [git-raw-commits](https://github.com/stevemao/git-raw-commits) docs. There are some defaults:

##### format

Default: `'%B%n-hash-%n%H%n-gitTags-%n%d%n-committerDate-%n%ci'`

##### from

Default: latest semver tag if `options.allBlocks` is `false`.

##### reverse

Default: only `true` if `options.append` is truthy.

#### parserOpts

See the [conventional-commits-parser](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-commits-parser) docs.

#### writerOpts

See the [conventional-changelog-writer](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-writer) docs. There are some defaults:

##### reverse

Default: same as `options.append`.

### CLI

```sh
$ npm install -g conventional-changelog
```

```sh
$ conventional-changelog --help

    -o, --outfile             Write the CHANGELOG to this file. If unspecified, it prints to stdout
    -w, --overwrite           Overwrite the infile
    -p, --preset              Name of the preset you want to use
    -k, --pkg                 A filepath of where your package.json is located

    -b, --all-blocks          Generate all blocks
    -v, --verbose             Verbose output
    -c, --context             A filepath of a javascript that is used to define template variables
    --git-raw-commits-opts    A filepath of a javascript that is used to define git-raw-commits options
    --parser-opts             A filepath of a javascript that is used to define conventional-commits-parser options
    --writer-opts             A filepath of a javascript that is used to define conventional-changelog-writer options

## Notes for parent modules

This module has options `append` and `allBlocks`. However, it doesn't read your previous changelog. Reasons being:

1. The old logs is just to be appended or prepended to the newly generated logs, which is a very simple thing that could be done in the parent module.
2. We want it to be very flexible for the parent module. You could create a readable stream from the file or you could just read the file.
3. We want the duty of this module to be very minimum.

So, when you build a parent module, you need to read the old logs and append or prepend to them based on `options.append`. If `options.allBlocks` is `true` you need to ignore any previous logs.
