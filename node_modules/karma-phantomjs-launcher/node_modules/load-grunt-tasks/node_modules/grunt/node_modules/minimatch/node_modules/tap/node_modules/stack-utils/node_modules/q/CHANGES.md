 - Address an issue that prevented Q from being used as a `<script>` for
   Firefox add-ons. Q can now be used in any environment that provides `window`
   or `self` globals, favoring `window` since add-ons have an an immutable
   `self` that is distinct from `window`.

## 1.3.0

 - Add tracking for unhandled and handled rejections in Node.js (@benjamingr).
