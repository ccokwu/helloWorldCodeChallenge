> Make a new GitHub release from git metadata


## Why

- Based on [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog).
- Everything internally or externally is pluggable.
- High performant. It doesn't spawn any extra child process to fetch data.
- Intelligently setup defaults but you can still modify them to your needs.
- Fully configurable. There are several presets that you can use if you just want to use the same conventions. But it is also possible to configure if you want to go down to the nth degree.
- Task runner integrations: [grunt](https://github.com/stevemao/grunt-conventional-github-releaser).
- Auto detects prerelease based on semver.
- Actively maintained.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save conventional-github-releaser
```

## Example output

- https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-github-releaser/releases
- https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/releases


## Usage

```js
var conventionalGithubReleaser = require('conventional-github-releaser');

var AUTH = {
  type: "oauth",
  token: '0126af95c0e2d9b0a7c78738c4c00a860b04acc8'
};

conventionalGithubReleaser(AUTH, changelogOpts, context, gitRawCommitsOpts, parserOpts, writerOpts, callback);
```


## API

### conventionalGithubReleaser(auth, [changelogOpts, [context, [gitRawCommitsOpts, [parserOpts, [writerOpts]]]]], callback)

#### auth

An auth object passed to [node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github#authentication).

#### callback

##### callback(err, responses)

###### responses

Type: `array`

An array of responses returned by `github.releases.createRelease` calls.

Please check [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) for other arguments.

There are some changes:

#### changelogOpts

##### transform

It matches the whole tag for the version including a leading v.

##### releaseCount

How many releases of changelog you want to generate. It counts from the latest semver tag. Useful when you forgot to generate any previous releases. Set to `0` to regenerate all.

#### gitRawCommitsOpts

##### from

Default: based on `options.releaseCount`.

##### to

Default: latest semver tag

#### writerOpts

##### includeDetails

It is always `true`.

##### headerPartial

If there is any preset, this defaults to `''` because header in presets usually contains the version and date which are already in the release.


## CLI

```sh
$ npm install --global conventional-github-releaser
$ conventional-github-releaser --help

  Make a new GitHub release from git metadata

  Usage
    conventional-github-releaser

  Example
    conventional-github-releaser -p angular

  Options
    -t, --token               Your auth token
    -p, --preset              Name of the preset you want to use
    -k, --pkg                 A filepath of where your package.json is located
    -r, --release-count       How many releases to be generated from the latest
    -v, --verbose             Verbose output
    -c, --context             A filepath of a javascript that is used to define template variables
    --git-raw-commits-opts    A filepath of a javascript that is used to define git-raw-commits options
    --parser-opts             A filepath of a javascript that is used to define conventional-commits-parser options
    --writer-opts             A filepath of a javascript that is used to define conventional-changelog-writer options
```

You can supply your auth token by a flag `-t` or `--token`. You can also set up an environment variable `CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN` to avoid typing your token every time.


## FAQ

### How can I regenerate all the releases?

Use [github-remove-all-releases](https://github.com/stevemao/github-remove-all-releases) to remove all releases and set `changelogOpts.allBlocks` to `true` to regenerate.

### How do I setup my token for cli?

[Create a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and set your environment variable `CONVENTIONAL_GITHUB_RELEASER_TOKEN` to the token you just created. You can google [How to set environment variable](https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20set%20environment%20variable). The scopes for the token you need is `public_repo` or `repo` (if you need to access private repos). [More details](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes).

### What's the recommended workflow?

1. Make changes
2. Commit those changes
3. Make sure Travis turns green
4. Bump version in `package.json`
5. Commit `package.json` files
6. Tag
7. Push
8. `conventionalGithubReleaser`

You have to have a tag to make a release. hence `gitRawCommitsOpts.to` defaults to the latest semver tag.
